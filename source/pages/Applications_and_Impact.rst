Institutional and Research Applications

The introduction outlined KiNESYS+'s three pillars: rapid model creation, online deployment, and collective learning. 
This section demonstrates how those principles have translated into real-world impact across national governments, 
research institutions, and corporations.

A New Scale of Deployment
==========================

Starting in 2022, **KiNESYS has evolved from a modeling framework into a global delivery platform** for collaborative energy system analysis.
Through its seamless integration with **Veda Online**, KiNESYS now enables dozens of national, regional, corporate, and research applications 
to run from a unified, cloud-based environment.

This evolution represents a significant shift in how advanced models are deployed:

* **Model building** has been replaced by **model generation**, with new country or sector modules assembled in days rather than months. 
  For example, the Croatia CCDR model was generated and calibrated in one week.
* **Scenario exploration** has become interactive and real-time, allowing analysts, policymakers, and corporations to engage directly with complex system dynamics.
* **Collaboration** has moved online — with multiple institutions sharing data structures, assumptions, and results through a single, version-controlled interface.

What once required large consultant teams and long iteration cycles is now executed by small, distributed groups who can run, review, 
and refine scenarios within hours. This transformation has turned KiNESYS + Veda Online into a **delivery layer for decision-grade modeling** 
across the global energy transition community.

Example: The World Bank's CCDR Program and Regional Reports
============================================================

The World Bank's **Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs)** and regional energy reports demonstrate this new modeling paradigm.
Each report integrates **KiNESYS model instances**, delivered and visualized through **Veda Online**. Analysts and ministry counterparts 
co-create policy pathways — adjusting carbon pricing, renewable targets, or technology restrictions — and see the effects immediately.

World Bank reports using KiNESYS include:

* `Croatia CCDR (2025) <https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/croatia/publication/croatia-country-climate-and-development-report>`_ [KiNESYS_Croatia]
* `Kyrgyz Republic CCDR (2025) <http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/099110325151085270>`_ [KiNESYS_CenAsia]
* `Poland CCDR (2024) <https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/1396095d-dbc1-4c7d-a19e-188171cc5950>`_ [KiNESYS_Poland]
* `Tajikistan CCDR (2024) <https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/tajikistan/publication/ccdr>`_ [KiNESYS_CenAsia]
* `Western Balkans-6 CCDR (2024) <https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/western-balkans-6-ccdr>`_ [KiNESYS_WB6]
* `Uzbekistan CCDR (2023) <https://api.mf.uz/media/document_files/file_F2XaRnt.pdf>`_ [KiNESYS_CenAsia]
* `Net Zero Energy by 2060: Charting the Path of Europe and Central Asia <https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/eb0f9895-360f-4a0b-8b9f-277b289bc06a>`_ [KiNESYS_ECA]
* `Enhancing Transport Decarbonization in the European Union (2024) <https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/publication/eu-transport-decarbonization>`_ [KiNESYS_ECA]

These models are collectively redefining how the World Bank conducts system-level policy dialogue — moving from static reports 
to **iterative, interactive decision environments**.

Research Integration — Multi-Model SDG Analysis
================================================

KiNESYS is also being used in global research linking energy systems with macroeconomic and environmental models.
In *Chepeliev M., Giannakidis G., Kanudia A., & van der Mensbrugghe D.* (2024),
`Implications of the Net Zero Transition Scenarios on SDG Indicators <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58897-6_3>`_ 
(Springer, *Lecture Notes in Energy vol 101*), KiNESYS forms the energy-system core of a tri-model framework that combines:

* **ENVISAGE** – a global CGE model capturing macroeconomic feedbacks
* **KiNESYS** – technology-rich, bottom-up energy transitions
* **TM5-FASST** – an atmospheric source-receptor model for air-pollution impacts

The study assesses 17 SDG indicators and finds that **recycling carbon-pricing revenues through reduced factor taxes** 
strengthens outcomes for most goals, while **monetized air-quality co-benefits** more than double the net welfare gains.
This demonstrates how KiNESYS can serve as the *bridge between system optimization and sustainable-development assessment*.

What These Applications Reveal
===============================

Reusable Frameworks Across Countries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same reporting and classification frameworks developed for Croatia were reused across Poland, Western Balkans-6, 
and Uzbekistan — eliminating months of rework and ensuring cross-country comparability. This portability allows 
consistent analysis across different national contexts.

Interactive Exploration Changes Engagement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ministry officials in CCDR workshops could adjust policy parameters and see results update in real-time on Veda Online — 
transforming passive review into active co-creation. The ability to explore multiple scenarios interactively fundamentally 
changed how stakeholders engaged with model insights.

Shared Knowledge Base Compounds Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When BP refined biomass conversion assumptions for bioresource analysis, those updates were shared with World Bank CCDRs. 
The shared knowledge base means improvements in one application can benefit others, creating a compounding effect where 
model quality improves with each deployment.

Speed Enables Iteration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The KiNESYS-S100 model for Argonne was generated, calibrated, and extended to Ukraine in under 6 weeks — a timeline 
impossible with traditional approaches. This speed allows teams to iterate rapidly, testing multiple configurations 
and exploring "what-if" questions that would otherwise be impractical.

The KiNESYS + Veda Online Impact
=================================

Together, these institutional and research deployments illustrate a fundamental transformation in how advanced models are used:

* **From bespoke builds → configurable instances** generated in days
* **From offline results → interactive cloud workspaces**
* **From consultant delivery → institutional ownership**

This model of distributed, cloud-based modeling has effectively created a **living ecosystem of connected energy-system models** — 
each grounded in local data but linked by shared architecture and methodology. It has enabled decision-makers across continents 
to explore their energy futures with unprecedented speed, transparency, and control — turning modeling itself into an act 
of collective learning.
